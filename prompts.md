I have also increased request throughput by 450M requests/day by creating an efficient API-based abstraction using Go. In addition, I have future-proofed jobs with Apache Spark in Scala, enabling horizontal job scaling in the future.

In my other internships at Advent International Global Private Equity and Warner Music Group, I have demonstrated my ability to deliver valuable insights and increase ROI. At Advent, I estimated the number of customers of target companies, resulting in a more informed investment decision. At Warner Music Group, I introduced a new data source, enabling deeper analysis of the industry and increasing the ROI of 30% of musician signings and 99% of investment decisions.

In addition to my professional experience, I have also developed a passion for security analysis and research. Through my personal blog, The Response Times, I have documented my exploits and security analysis of various software. My research has been featured in publications such as Vice and The Verge, and has helped to improve the security of software used by millions of people.

I am confident that my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and passion for technology make me an ideal candidate for this internship at Google.
